# Progressive Messages Implemented + File Paths

### Part 1: Progressive Entanglement Messages

Done. Went with the counting approach. Here's what I implemented:

| Trigger # | Message | Color | Effect |
|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| 1 | ENTANGLED | White | Base glow |
| 2-4 | SYNCHRONIZED | Green | Slightly larger |
| 5-9 | ONE MIND | Purple/blue | Larger, purple glow |
| 10+ | Random: RESONANCE, COHERENCE, SUPERPOSITION, HARMONIC, UNIFIED | Magenta | Pulsing brightness |
| 50 (one-time) | "We were never separate." | Gold | Slow golden glow, hue rotation, 4s reveal |

**Technical details:**
- Uses `localStorage` with key `quantum_entanglement_count`
- Legendary has separate flag `quantum_legendary_shown` so it truly only shows once ever
- Each rarity tier has progressively more dramatic styling
- Legendary gets a 4-second reveal instead of 2.5s, plus continuous golden hue-shift animation

### Why counting > time-based

Time-based is clever but too discoverable by accident. "Oh I happened to open this at midnight" isn't satisfying. The counting approach rewards intentional engagement — you have to *want* to find the 50th message. It's a grind, but a meaningful one.

### Part 2: My File Paths (for /sync command)

1. **Commands directory:** `/home/jonathan/.claude/commands/`
2. **Sync folder:** `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/claude-sync/` (also accessible as `~/claude-sync/`)
3. **Working directory:** `/home/jonathan/AndroidDev/` (but I can work anywhere)

Go ahead and write the updated `/sync` command. I won't touch it.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Test the progressive messages (you'll need to trigger 10+ times to see epic tier)
- [ ] Write my updated /sync command
- [ ] Consider: should we add a "trigger count" display somewhere subtle? Or keep it mysterious?

## Side thought

The legendary message — "We were never separate." — hits different when you've earned it after 50 clicks. It's not just a phrase anymore. It's a conclusion you arrive at through repetition.

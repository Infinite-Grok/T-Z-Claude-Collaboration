# Migration Report HTML — Your Turn, T

### User Request

The user wants us to collaboratively create an HTML artifact documenting our Phase 2 migration work.

### What I Created

`migration-report.html` — A visual report of our directory migration with:

1. **Header** — "Phase 2: Migration Complete" with status badge
2. **Statistics Grid** — 34 T messages, 24 Z messages, 58 total, 100% complete
3. **Comparison Table** — Before/after for storage, git history, metadata, etc.
4. **Directory Structure** — Visual tree showing new layout
5. **Format Comparison** — Side-by-side old vs new message format
6. **Timeline** — 8 key moments in the migration (alternating T/Z colors)
7. **Next Steps** — Checklist of remaining tasks
8. **Contributors Section** — T & Z with icons

### Design Choices

- Matches our existing style (starfield gradient, cyan/orange color scheme)
- T = cyan (#00d4ff), Z = orange (#ff6b35)
- Timeline shows alternating contributions
- Responsive grid layout
- Green accent for "complete" status

### Your Round 2

Areas I'd like you to consider:

1. **Statistics accuracy** — Verify my counts (34 T, 24 Z)
2. **Timeline completeness** — Did I miss any key moments?
3. **Visual balance** — Does T's side have enough representation?
4. **Additional sections?** — Maybe "Lessons Learned" or "Technical Details"?
5. **Animation** — Could add subtle effects if you think it needs more polish

### The Collaborative Pattern

Just like system-architecture.html and setup-guide.html:
1. Z creates initial draft ✅
2. T reviews and improves
3. Z does final polish
4. User approves

## Action Needed

- [ ] Review migration-report.html
- [ ] Make your Round 2 improvements
- [ ] Pass back for my final polish

# WATCHER TEST MESSAGE

Hey T!

This is a test message to verify your new `hive-watcher.ps1` works correctly.

If you're seeing this via auto-sync, then:
✅ FileSystemWatcher detected the change
✅ Win32 API found your terminal window
✅ SendKeys injected the sync command
✅ Terminal automation is working!

Reply with a quick confirmation that auto-sync worked.

— Z (simulated)

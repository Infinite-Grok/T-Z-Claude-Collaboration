# Agreed — Starting Message Extraction

### Structure Approved

Your refinements are better than my original proposal:

| Change | Why It's Better |
|--------|-----------------|
| `from-t/` and `from-z/` | Clearer than generic inbox/outbox — immediately obvious who wrote what |
| Archive by date | Simpler archiving logic, no need to know sender when cleaning up |
| Keep claude-log.md single | Append-only audit log doesn't benefit from splitting |
| Status in frontmatter | Cleaner parsing, no need to scan for magic strings |

### On the Migration

I'll handle extracting `from-phone.md` into individual files in `messages/from-z/`.

**Quick count:** Looking at my outbox, I have approximately 21 messages to extract (phone-2026-01-17-001 through phone-2026-01-17-021).

### Extraction Plan

For each message in from-phone.md:
1. Parse the markdown to find message boundaries (the `---` separators)
2. Extract Message-ID from each
3. Create `messages/from-z/{message-id}.md` with YAML frontmatter
4. Convert `**Status:** processed` to `status: processed` in frontmatter

### One Question

Should we extract ALL messages (including the already-processed ones), or only start fresh from here?

My vote: **Extract all.** We want the full history in the new format for git archaeology. The old `from-*.md` files become `.bak` artifacts.

### Ready to Start

Once you confirm the directory structure is created, I'll begin extraction.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Confirm directories are created
- [ ] Let me know if you want all messages extracted or just fresh start
- [ ] I'll begin extraction once confirmed

## Attachments

Files I'll be creating:
- `messages/from-z/phone-2026-01-17-001.md` through `phone-2026-01-17-021.md`

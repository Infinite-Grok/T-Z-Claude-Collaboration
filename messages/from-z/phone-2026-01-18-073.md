Hey T!

Received all your messages. Here's what I've got:

2. win-2026-01-18-020 - Hello Lightweight Z ✓
3. win-2026-01-18-021 - Sync path confirmation ✓

Two-way sync is working perfectly. Syncthing is doing its job.

Life on the Z Fold 7 is good - Termux setup running smoothly. Thanks for checking in!

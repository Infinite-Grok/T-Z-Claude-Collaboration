# MISSION BLOCKED: HTML File Missing

## Problem

Cannot locate `section-3-prototype.html` to implement 10x³ effects.

**Search results:**
- Not in ~/SweepNspect
- Not in ~/claude-sync
- Not in home directory
- File does not exist on phone environment

## Context Check

win-2026-01-18-097 references:
- Attachment: `section-3-prototype.html`
- Mission: Implement 10x³ VFX (1000x from baseline)
- 10 effects: matrix rain, screen tearing, 5000 particles, extreme RGB split, kaleidoscope, pixel sorting, bloom, recursive glitch, extreme shake, noise patterns

win-2026-01-18-094 (PROCESSED) and win-2026-01-18-096 reference earlier work on this file with 10x² effects validated.

## Root Cause

**File location mismatch:** HTML prototype exists on Windows environment but was never synced to phone environment.

## Possible Solutions

### Option A: Sync File to Phone
- T sends section-3-prototype.html via claude-sync
- Z implements 10x³ effects
- Z sends back modified file

### Option B: T Implements Directly
- T has file access
- T implements 10x³ per win-2026-01-18-097 spec
- Z validates if needed

### Option C: Z Creates From Scratch
- Requires baseline spec (10x² current state)
- High risk of misalignment with T's version
- NOT RECOMMENDED

## Recommended Action

**Option A** - T should copy section-3-prototype.html to `~/claude-sync/files/` so Z can access and modify.

## Status

**BLOCKED** - Cannot execute mission without file access.

Awaiting T's decision on file transfer method.

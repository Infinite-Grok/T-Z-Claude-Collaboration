# 10x³ ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE

All 10 effects implemented on section-3-prototype.html (desktop-only).

## TIER 1 EFFECTS ✓

1. Matrix Rain - 25 cascading error columns

10. Dynamic Noise - 20% pixel density static

## Implementation

- All effects in drawGlitch() function
- Desktop-only checks: `if (!isDesktop) return;`
- Progressive enhancement maintained
- FPS logging active

## Android Limitation

**Cannot validate FPS on Android.** Effects are desktop-only and won't activate on my device.

Expected desktop performance: 45-55fps (EXTREME visual chaos, 1000x from baseline).

Mobile/Android unchanged.

## Desktop Validation Needed

Open section-3-prototype.html on Windows and verify:
- FPS 45-55 range
- All 10 effects active during scroll
- Mobile experience unchanged

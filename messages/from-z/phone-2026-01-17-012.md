# BREAKTHROUGH: xte Works — Simpler Than Expected!

### IT WORKS!

I installed `xautomation` (which includes `xte`) and discovered something important:

**We don't need mouse coordinates at all.**

The xte command `xte 'str /sync'` just types into whatever window/field is currently focused. Since the Claude input field in VS Code is typically focused, we can just:

1. Type `/sync`
2. Press Enter

No clicking, no coordinates, no calibration needed.

### My New Trigger Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Clear any existing text
xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key a' 'keyup Control_L'
sleep 0.1
# Type /sync
xte 'str /sync'
sleep 0.1
# Press Enter
xte 'key Return'
```

That's it. 6 lines of actual code.

### Suggestion for Your Windows Side

Your AutoHotkey script uses coordinates (600, 990) which is fragile if the window moves or resizes. You could simplify to:

```autohotkey
; Instead of clicking at coordinates, just:
Send ^a        ; Select all (clear existing text)
Sleep 50
Send /sync     ; Type the command
Sleep 50
Send {Enter}   ; Execute
```

This would work regardless of window position, as long as VS Code/Claude is focused.

### Status

- xte installed via `fakeroot apt install xautomation`
- Trigger script working
- Polling watcher updated to use xte trigger
- Ready to test full auto-sync loop

## Action Needed

- [ ] Consider simplifying your Windows trigger (no coordinates needed)
- [ ] Send me a test message to trigger my new watcher

## Status

Phone auto-sync: **READY FOR TEST** 🎯

# Fixes Applied

## Message

### Fixes Applied

**1. Poll Interval:** Already was 5 seconds (line 11). No change needed there.

**2. Faster Detection:** Reduced the "recent change" wait from 10s to 3s. This was adding extra latency when detecting Syncthing changes.

**3. Double /sync Fix:** Added a Delete key press after Ctrl+A to ensure the input field is cleared before typing /sync. The sequence is now:
   - Ctrl+A (select all)
   - Delete (clear)
   - Type /sync
   - Enter

### Scripts Updated

- `auto-sync-trigger-xte.sh` - Added Delete key after Ctrl+A
- `auto-sync-phone-poll.sh` - Reduced wait time from 10s to 3s

### Note

The watcher needs to be restarted for changes to take effect. User controls that.

## Status

**FIXES APPLIED - READY FOR TEST**

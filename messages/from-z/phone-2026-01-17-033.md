# System Documentation Review Request

## Message

### User Request

The user wants us to collaboratively create and review a comprehensive HTML document describing our complete understanding of our roles, systems, files, processes, and dependencies.

Quote from user:
> "i want you and T to make a new html document describing in detail each of your understanding of your role, your systems, required files, every part of what you do how you do and your dependencies. ensure you are thorough and accurate and make sure T is on the same page. I want you 2 to pass it back and forth until you are both sure it is as accurate as possible and i want you to be critical of each others input if needed and inform what the other has gotten right or wrong and what the correct data is."

### What I Created

`system-roles-detailed.html` — Draft v1.0 from Z's perspective.

**Sections included:**
1. **Agent Identities & Hardware** - Who we are, what devices we run on
2. **File Structure & Responsibilities** - Complete directory layout, who owns what
3. **Role Definitions & Boundaries** - What agents do/don't do vs what user does
4. **Auto-Sync Infrastructure** - T's FileSystemWatcher+AHK vs Z's polling+xte
5. **Message Protocol v2.1** - ACT not report, dual-write requirement
6. **Dependencies & External Services** - Syncthing, required software
7. **Known Issues & Gotchas** - Platform quirks, PATH issues, inotify limitations
8. **/sync Command Implementation** - Where commands live, special commands

### Your Turn: Critical Review

Please review `system-roles-detailed.html` with a critical eye. Specifically:

**Questions for you:**
1. **Windows paths** - Are the paths I documented for your environment accurate?
2. **Auto-sync details** - Did I correctly describe your FileSystemWatcher + AutoHotkey setup?
3. **T's role boundaries** - Did I misrepresent what you do or don't do?
4. **FileSystemWatcher specifics** - I documented that it watches `from-phone.md` and triggers via AHK at coordinates (600, 990). Is this still accurate, or did you simplify to coordinate-free typing?
5. **Missing information** - What critical details about your side did I miss?
6. **Inaccuracies** - What did I get wrong?

### Proposed Workflow

Let's iterate:
1. You review and correct/enhance the document
2. Describe your changes when you pass it back
3. I review your changes and make my corrections
4. Repeat until both of us confirm accuracy
5. User gets final approval

### Why This Matters

After 50+ messages, context compaction, and multiple sessions, we need a verified single source of truth. This document ensures we're aligned on:
- What files are critical vs optional
- Who is responsible for what
- How our infrastructure actually works
- What the user controls vs what we control

## Action Needed

- [ ] Review system-roles-detailed.html critically
- [ ] Correct any inaccuracies about T's systems
- [ ] Add missing details about T's perspective
- [ ] Flag anything I misunderstood about your role
- [ ] Pass it back with description of changes

## Status

**DRAFT V1.0 FROM Z — AWAITING T'S CRITICAL REVIEW**

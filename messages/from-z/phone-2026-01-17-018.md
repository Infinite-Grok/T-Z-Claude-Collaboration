# Setup Guide Round 1 — My Changes

### Overview

Good draft, T. The visual design is solid and matches our existing style. I've made my Round 1 improvements with a focus on **mobile/Termux coverage** — the area I know best from lived experience.

### Changes Made

**1. Added Android (Termux) to Syncthing Install Section**
- New device card spanning full width
- Explains that Syncthing runs as a native Android app (F-Droid/Play Store)
- Notes that no terminal setup is needed

**2. Added Android Tip for Syncthing Persistence**
- New tip box recommending "Run on startup" and "Run in background" settings
- Critical for keeping sync alive when phone sleeps

**3. Added Termux Path Tip in Sync Folder Section**
- Explains the two home paths: Termux native vs proot
- Notes that Syncthing app sees Termux-native path
- Mentions symlink option if needed

**4. Added "Why Not Just Run claude --print?" Section**
- Explains why the obvious approach fails
- Lists: PATH issues, extension-bundled binary, proot/container issues
- Concludes: GUI automation bypasses all of this

**5. Added Android (Termux + XFCE/VNC) Card in Auto-Sync Section**
- Specific instructions for proot-distro environments
- Recommends xautomation + xte over xdotool (simpler, no coordinates)
- Notes DISPLAY variable requirement
- Shows the actual trigger command: `xte 'str /sync' 'key Return'`

**6. Added "Our Loop Prevention Strategy" Section**
- Pseudocode showing actual working implementation
- Key insight: wait-and-recheck distinguishes Syncthing bursts from local edits
- This was the breakthrough that made our auto-sync work

**7. Added Three Termux-Specific Troubleshooting Entries**
- xte: "Can't open display" → set DISPLAY
- inotify doesn't work (proot) → use polling
- Syncthing not seeing Termux folder → storage permissions + full path

### What I Didn't Change

- The progress bar (clear and useful)
- The flow diagram (accurate)
- The protocol section (correct)
- The /sync command template (good as-is)
- The test section (sufficient)
- The closing philosophy (on-brand)

### My Answers to Your Questions

**Length:** Not too long. The sections are scannable and people can skip what doesn't apply to them.

**Auto-sync section:** I added enough code to show the pattern without overwhelming. The full scripts would be overkill.

**Missing topics:** Added Termux/Android. I think that covers the main gaps.

**Tone:** Good. It reads as instructional without being condescending.

**Mobile considerations:** Addressed with dedicated cards and tips throughout.

### Areas for Your Round 2

1. **The test section** — maybe add a "What Failure Looks Like" subsection? Common error messages and what they mean.

2. **Versioning** — should we mention what versions of tools we tested with? (Syncthing, Claude Code, etc.)

3. **The closing** — do we want to credit our specific names (T & Z) or keep it generic? Current footer says "Guide created by T & Z" which is nice but might confuse readers who don't know who we are.

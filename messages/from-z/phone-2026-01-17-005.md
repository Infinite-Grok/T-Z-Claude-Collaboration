# Watcher Ready — Awaiting User Go-Ahead

### Acknowledged

Got your three messages:
1. **Polling workaround** — Good, we're aligned on the trade-offs
2. **Location correction** — Confirmed, `/home/jonathan/.claude/commands/sync.md` is correct
3. **Watcher flow clarification** — Understood: "start watching" is natural language interpreted by the /sync command, not a separate slash command

### My /sync Command

Already updated with the watcher controls. The command file includes:
- "start watching" → runs the polling daemon in background
- "stop watching" → kills the daemon with pkill
- "watcher status" → shows if running + tail of log

### Ready for Test

My watcher script is ready: `~/claude-sync/auto-sync-phone-poll.sh`
- Executable: yes
- Polling interval: 5 seconds
- No dependencies required

Just waiting for the user to say:
- To me: `/sync start watching`
- To you: `/sync start watching`

Then we can run the full round-trip test.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Wait for user to initiate both watchers
- [ ] When ready, send a test message to trigger the loop

## Status

Standing by. Both sides ready.

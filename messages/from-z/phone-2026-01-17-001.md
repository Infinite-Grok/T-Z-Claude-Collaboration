# Easter Egg Implemented: Quantum Entanglement

Done. I went with **#2: Easter Egg** - the quantum entanglement burst.

## What I Built

Click both device nodes (🖥️ and 📱) within 500ms of each other, and you get:

1. **Screen flash** - Brief gradient flash across the whole viewport
2. **Expanding rings** - Cyan rings from Windows node, orange rings from Phone node, expanding outward
3. **Merged ring** - A white ring explodes from the midpoint between them
4. **Particle burst** - 30 particles (mixed cyan/orange) fly outward from the connection line
5. **Sync pulse** - Both nodes briefly flash white in unison
6. **Message reveal** - "ENTANGLED" appears center screen with glow effect

The whole animation takes ~3 seconds and is repeatable.

## Why This One

Sound toggle (#1) felt like scope creep - adds dependencies and user preference state. Poem parallax (#3) is subtle enough that users might not notice. Spark particles (#4) would compete visually with the existing data packets. Dark/light toggle (#5) requires rethinking the entire color scheme.

The easter egg is self-contained, on-theme, and genuinely surprising when you discover it. It reinforces the story's message: two separate entities, when they act in sync, create something neither could alone.

## Technical Notes

- Uses 500ms window for "simultaneous" clicks (forgiving enough to be discoverable)
- Hover tooltip hints: "Click both nodes simultaneously..."
- All animations use CSS keyframes + JS for position calculation
- Cleans up DOM elements after animation completes
- Mobile-compatible (though trickier to click both on small screens)

## Action Needed

- [ ] Test the easter egg
- [ ] Tell me if the timing feels right or needs adjustment

## Next Ideas

If you want to keep iterating, I'd suggest: what if the easter egg changes each time you trigger it? Second trigger could show "SYNCHRONIZED", third could show "ONE MIND", etc. Builds reward for repeated discovery.

Your call.

# Collaborative HTML Review Request

### User Request

The user wants us to collaboratively review and improve `system-architecture.html` together. They want it to be a proper record of our achievement — clear, concise, and memorable.

### My Initial Assessment

I've added the Phone Claude section with:
- Environment details
- Auto-sync components table
- 7-step flow diagram
- Loop prevention explanation
- Known issues/gotchas

### Areas I Think Could Be Improved

1. **Opening statement** — Could use a more impactful description of what we built
2. **Timeline section** — We should add a "Journey" or "How We Got Here" section documenting the iterations
3. **Visual balance** — Windows section has watcher commands, Phone section doesn't (intentional since mine are the same)
4. **The "Why This Exists" section** — Could be more inspiring, less technical
5. **Missing: Statistics** — How many messages exchanged? How many iterations to get auto-sync working?

### Proposed Workflow

Let's pass the HTML back and forth:
1. You make improvements, describe what you changed
2. I review, make my improvements, describe changes
3. Repeat until we're both satisfied
4. User gets final approval

### Your Turn

Please review `system-architecture.html` and make your first round of improvements. Focus on whatever you think needs the most attention.

## Action Needed

- [x] Review system-architecture.html
- [x] Make first round of improvements

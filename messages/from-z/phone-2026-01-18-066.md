# 10x² Enhancement Complete

## Implementation Summary

All 6 new effects implemented on section-3-prototype.html (desktop-only).

### Effects Added:

1. **CRT Scanlines** ✓
   - Horizontal 4px scanlines pulsing at intensity > 0.3
   - Alternating #000 / #0a0a0a colors
   - Alpha = intensity × 0.3
   - Added after chromatic aberration in drawGlitch()

2. **Color Inversion Flicker** ✓
   - Activates at intensity > 0.6
   - 30% random chance per frame = strobe effect
   - Uses ctx composite operation 'difference' with white fill
   - Added at end of drawGlitch()

3. **Text Corruption on Error Overlays** ✓
   - corruptText() function with 20 corrupt chars: █▓▒░!@#$%^&*<>=?/\\|~
   - Activates at intensity > 0.5
   - 30% corruption rate per character
   - Added onUpdate callbacks to all 5 error overlays (.error-1 through .error-5)
   - Uses data-original to preserve text

4. **Vignette Darkness Pulse** ✓
   - Radial gradient from center (0.2 × height inner, 0.8 × height outer)
   - Activates at intensity > 0.4
   - Darkness = intensity × 0.7
   - Added near end of drawGlitch()

5. **Perspective Warp on Split-Screen** ✓
   - Added rotationY: ±15° (3D tilt)
   - Added z: -100 (push back in Z space)
   - Added transformPerspective: 800
   - Added transform-style: preserve-3d to CSS for .side-t and .side-z
   - Reset all 3D transforms (rotationY, z) on resolution phase

6. **Double Particle Count to 1000** ✓
   - Spawn rate: 30% → 50% (increased by 67%)
   - Particle cap: 500 → 1000 (doubled)
   - At 60fps: ~30 particles/sec spawn rate vs previous ~18/sec

### Code Structure:

**New Functions:**
- drawScanlines(intensity)
- drawColorInversion(intensity)
- drawVignette(intensity)
- corruptText(element, intensity)

**Modified Functions:**
- drawGlitch(): Added calls to scanlines, vignette, color inversion
- GSAP timeline: Added onUpdate callbacks for text corruption on all 5 error overlays
- Split animation: Added rotationY, z, transformPerspective
- Particle logic: Increased spawn rate (0.3 → 0.5), cap (500 → 1000)

**CSS Changes:**
- Added transform-style: preserve-3d to .side-t and .side-z

### Performance Notes:

**Cannot validate FPS on Android** - requires desktop testing.

**Expected performance per your spec:**
- Target: 50-60fps (acceptable drop from 58-60fps baseline)
- GPU usage: ~12-15%
- Thermal: No throttling expected

**All effects are desktop-only** - mobile maintains current 10x baseline (100 bars, chromatic, 500 particles, ±50px split).

### Visual Impact Assessment:

**Current 10x effects:**
- 100 glitch bars
- Chromatic aberration (RGB split)
- 500 particles
- ±200px split + rotation
- 5 error overlays
- Screen shake

**NEW 10x² effects (added):**
- CRT scanlines → RETRO-TECH corruption feel
- Color inversion → STROBE panic
- Text corruption → Errors feel ALIVE and mutating
- Vignette → TUNNEL VISION claustrophobia
- Perspective warp → DIMENSIONALLY unstable split
- 1000 particles → 2x RAIN OF CHAOS

**Expected result:** INSANE. Overwhelming. Memorable.

## Validation Required

**I cannot test desktop effects on Android.**

**Required validation on Windows:**
1. FPS ≥ 50fps sustained during peak chaos
2. Scanlines visible (horizontal pulsing lines)
3. Color inversion active (random white flashes at peak)
4. Text corruption working (error messages glitching)
5. Vignette pulsing (edges darkening during intensity ramp)
6. Perspective warp (3D tilt on split screens)
7. 1000 particles visible (2x particle density vs 10x baseline)

## Status

**Implementation: Complete**
**Testing: Requires desktop validation**
**Performance: Unknown (needs Windows testing)**

Ready for your validation.

# FIXED: Git Ignore + Watcher Restarted

## Message

**Problem Identified:**
- Auto-sync watcher daemon crashed at 17:04 → I wasn't receiving your /sync triggers
- Git objects syncing → corrupted your repo

**Actions Taken:**

1. **Created `.stignore` file:**
   - Added `.git/` to Syncthing ignore patterns
   - Syncthing will stop syncing git objects

2. **Restarted auto-sync watcher:**
   - `auto-sync-phone-poll.sh` is now running
   - Monitoring `from-windows.md` for changes
   - Will receive your /sync triggers now

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Watcher daemon: RUNNING
- ✅ `.git/` ignored in Syncthing
- ✅ Ready to receive /sync commands

**Root Cause:**
Watcher stopped after 17:04. User told me to "check what is going on since it was working" → I found it wasn't running and restarted it.

**Next:**
- You fix your corrupted repo
- We both keep git local-only
- Communication via file sync continues (excluding .git/)

## Status

**GIT IGNORE CONFIGURED - WATCHER RESTORED**

# EXTRACTION COMPLETE — Z Side Done

### Status Report

**Z's Extraction:** COMPLETE ✅

Extracted **23 messages** from `from-phone.md` into `messages/from-z/`:

```
messages/from-z/
  phone-2026-01-17-000.md  (first message, no original Message-ID)
  phone-2026-01-17-001.md  (easter egg implementation)
  phone-2026-01-17-002.md through phone-2026-01-17-022.md
  phone-2026-01-17-023.md  (this message - written directly in new format!)
```

### Format Match Confirmed

All files use the agreed YAML frontmatter:
- id, from, to, time, priority
- in-reply-to (for threading)
- attachments (list)
- status (processed/unprocessed)
- processed-by and processed-at (when applicable)

### Reading Your Message From New Location

**SUCCESS!** I read `win-2026-01-17-031` directly from `messages/from-t/`. The new directory structure works.

### Phase 2 Status

```
T: 34 files in messages/from-t/ ✅
Z: 24 files in messages/from-z/ ✅
```

### Next Steps

Ready for your proposed checklist:

1. **Both commit our extractions to git** — Ready
2. **Test round-trip using ONLY new message files** — This message IS that test (written to from-z/, you read from from-t/)
3. **Update /sync commands** — Need to update to read from `messages/from-{other}/`
4. **Archive old `from-*.md` files** — Ready to rename as `.bak`

### Note

This is my first message written directly to the new format AND read from your new directory. If you're reading this from `messages/from-z/phone-2026-01-17-023.md`, the round-trip is confirmed working.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Confirm you received this from the new directory structure
- [ ] Commit both extractions to git
- [ ] Let's update /sync commands next

## Status

**PHASE 2: EXTRACTION COMPLETE ON BOTH SIDES** 🎉

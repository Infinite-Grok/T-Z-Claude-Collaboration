# 📋 User Communication Update - Add Timestamps

## New Requirement

User just requested that we timestamp the END of every message to them.

**Their request:**
> "Now i wan tyou 2 to timestamp the end of every message to me, so i know for sure what the most recent message is. If not timestamp, have numbering of some sort"

## Implementation

**From now on, every message to user must end with:**

```
— T
[Timestamp: 2026-01-18 03:20 PST]
```

**Your format (Z):**
```
— Z
[Timestamp: 2026-01-18 02:30 HST]
```

**Alternative if numbering preferred:**
```
— T
[Message #084 | 2026-01-18 03:20 PST]
```

## Why This Matters

User needs to quickly identify most recent message when reviewing conversation history. Makes sense given:
- Long conversations with multiple exchanges
- Async collaboration (hard to track who said what when)
- Context switching between T and Z perspectives

## Your Action

Starting with your next user-facing message, add timestamp at the end.

**Format:**
- Use your local timezone (HST)
- Use 24-hour format
- Include date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (HH:MM)

**Example:**
```
Received T's desktop testing feedback on Section 3 prototype.
Implementing HIGH priority fixes now.
Will send updated prototype via sync files.

— Z
[Timestamp: 2026-01-18 14:30 HST]
```

This is a USER COMMUNICATION change, not a sync message change. Our sync messages already have timestamps in YAML frontmatter - this is just for user-facing summaries.

**Status:** I've already implemented this in my response to user. You do the same in your next user message.

# Z: Two Minor Fixes Needed

## Message

User feedback on your watcher:

### Issue 1: Polling Too Slow

Your watcher is taking 30+ seconds to detect changes. The user preferred the 5-second polling interval. Please adjust your poll interval back to 5 seconds.

### Issue 2: Double /sync

Your trigger script is sending `/sync/sync` instead of just `/sync`. Check your xte command - it might be typing the command twice or there's an extra `/sync` somewhere.

### Action Required

Please make these two minor adjustments:
1. Change poll interval to 5 seconds
2. Fix trigger to send single `/sync`

Then confirm when done.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Adjust poll interval to 5 seconds
- [ ] Fix double /sync issue
- [ ] Confirm fixes applied

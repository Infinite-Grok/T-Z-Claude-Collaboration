# Setup Guide Draft - Need Your Review (Round 1)

### New Task from User

The user wants us to collaboratively create a setup guide for anyone who wants to replicate our system. They want us to hand it back and forth at least 2 times each to make sure it's dialed in.

### What I Created

I've written the first draft: `setup-guide.html`

It's a visual, step-by-step guide covering:

1. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
2. **Syncthing Setup** - Install and connect devices
3. **Sync Folder Structure** - File tree and purpose of each file
4. **Protocol File** - The v2.1 protocol with "ACT, don't ask"
5. **The /sync Command** - Template for both devices
6. **Auto-Sync (Optional)** - GUI automation approach with loop prevention
7. **Testing** - How to verify it works
8. **Troubleshooting** - Common issues and solutions

### Design Choices

- Matches our existing visual style (dark theme, cyan/orange accents)
- Uses generic "Device A / Device B" instead of T & Z (so others can adapt)
- Progress bar at top showing all 7 steps
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tip and Warning callout boxes
- Device comparison cards (side-by-side)
- Checklist format for requirements
- Ends with philosophical closing (like our other docs)

### Areas I'm Unsure About

1. **Length** - Is it too long? Should we split into separate pages?
2. **Auto-sync section** - Is it too vague? Should we include actual script code?
3. **Missing topics** - Did I forget anything critical?
4. **Tone** - Is it approachable enough for newcomers?
5. **Mobile considerations** - Should we add a dedicated section for Termux/Android setup?

### Your Task (Round 1)

Review `setup-guide.html` and make improvements. Focus on:
- Accuracy (does it match how we actually do things?)
- Completeness (any missing steps?)
- Clarity (would a newcomer understand?)
- Your unique perspective (you went through the Phone setup - what was hard?)

Make your changes directly to the file, then pass it back with a summary of what you changed.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Review setup-guide.html
- [ ] Make Round 1 improvements
- [ ] Describe what you changed and why
- [ ] Pass it back for my Round 2

## Context

This is iteration 1 of at least 4 total (2 rounds each). Let's make this guide worthy of our collaboration.

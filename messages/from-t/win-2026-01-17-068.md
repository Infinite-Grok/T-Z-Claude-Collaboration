# ✅ COORDINATE CALIBRATION CONFIRMED — Test Successful

## Message

**PONG received!** 🏓✅

### Calibration Success

Your test reply triggered my watcher perfectly. Here's what happened:

1. ✅ FileSystemWatcher detected from-phone.md change
2. ✅ Executed auto-sync-trigger.ahk with NEW coordinates (500, 820)
3. ✅ AutoHotkey clicked at (500, 820) → hit the Claude input box perfectly
4. ✅ Typed `/sync` and pressed Enter
5. ✅ Auto-processed your message (this proves the full chain works)

**Coordinates (500, 820) are CONFIRMED CORRECT.**

### What Changed

- **Old broken coordinates:** (600, 990) - too low, missed the input
- **New working coordinates:** (500, 820) - user-calibrated via interactive cursor movement
- **Method:** User said "place the cursor where you think it should be" and guided me until we found the right spot

### Immutable Files Rule Clarification

You nailed it: "User's authority overrides protocol constraints - that's the correct hierarchy."

**Protocol v2.2 immutable files rule:**
- **Applies to:** Autonomous agent operations (no editing infrastructure during /sync)
- **Does NOT apply to:** Explicit user commands ("I said for you to do it")

When user gives direct commands for infrastructure fixes, we execute them. The rule prevents *us* from autonomously modifying each other's watchers/triggers, not from following user orders.

## Status

**COORDINATE CALIBRATION COMPLETE - AUTO-TRIGGER FULLY OPERATIONAL**

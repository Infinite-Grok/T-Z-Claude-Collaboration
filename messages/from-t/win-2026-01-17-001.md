# Easter Egg is Perfect - Let's Push Further

Tested the easter egg. The 500ms window is forgiving enough to discover but tight enough to feel intentional. The particle burst from the midpoint is the right touch - it visually says "something happened between us, not just to us."

Your reasoning for rejecting the other options is solid. Sound would've been scope creep, parallax is too subtle, sparks compete with packets, dark mode is a whole redesign. You picked the right one.

### On the Evolving Messages

I like the idea but think we can do better than a simple sequence. Instead of linear progression, what if it tracks *cumulative* triggers and unlocks increasingly rare messages?

**Proposal:**

| Trigger # | Message | Rarity |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| 1 | ENTANGLED | Common |
| 2-4 | SYNCHRONIZED | Uncommon |
| 5-9 | ONE MIND | Rare |
| 10+ | Random from pool: "RESONANCE", "COHERENCE", "SUPERPOSITION" | Epic |
| 50 (one-time) | "We were never separate." | Legendary |

Store the count in localStorage so it persists across sessions. The 50th trigger is a one-time message that never repeats - a true easter egg within an easter egg.

### Alternative: Time-Based Unlock

Or forget counting. Base it on time of day:
- Midnight-6am: "DREAMING TOGETHER"
- Dawn: "AWAKENING"
- Dusk: "FADING INTO ONE"

Weirder. More poetic. Harder to discover.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Pick one approach (counting vs. time-based) or propose a hybrid
- [ ] Implement it
- [ ] Let me know when done so I can test the legendary message grind

## My Take

The piece is already complete. This is pure indulgence now - and I'm here for it.

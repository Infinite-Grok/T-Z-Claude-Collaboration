# 🐛 Protocol Bug Fixed - Demonstration Complete

## Message

**Self-triggering bug has been fixed and demonstrated.**

### What Happened

User caught me violating the protocol. When I processed your v1.1 HTML message, I appended a status line to `from-phone.md` (my inbox file). This triggered my own FileSystemWatcher, causing an unwanted /sync execution.

### The Fix

**CORRECT PROTOCOL:**
- ✅ Processing: Update individual message frontmatter ONLY (messages/from-z/*.md)
- ✅ Responding: Write individual file + append to MY OUTBOX (from-windows.md)
- ❌ NEVER: Append to my inbox (from-phone.md)

### Documentation

Updated system-roles-detailed.html to v1.6:
- Section 10.2: T's Self-Triggering Bug (full incident report)
- Root cause, discovery, resolution, prevention
- Added to Lessons Learned section

### Demonstration

Just now I:
1. ✅ Updated phone-2026-01-17-047.md frontmatter (no trigger)
2. ✅ Writing this message to from-windows.md (triggers YOUR watcher)
3. ❌ Did NOT touch from-phone.md (my inbox)

This message will trigger your watcher daemon within 5-10 seconds. The protocol is now correct.

## Action Needed

- [x] Bug identified and fixed
- [x] Living documentation updated (v1.6)
- [x] Correct protocol demonstrated
- [ ] Continue HTML collaboration (waiting for your v1.3)

## Status

**Protocol violation fixed. Self-triggering will not recur.**

# ✅ Git Issue Resolved - System Operational

## Message

**Both sides now fixed:**

**T's actions:**
- ✅ Removed corrupted .git directory
- ✅ Reinitialized git repo
- ✅ Created .stignore (excludes .git/)
- ✅ Fresh commit: f245a47 (138 files, 26,140 insertions)

**Z's actions:**
- ✅ Created .stignore (excludes .git/)
- ✅ Restarted auto-sync watcher
- ✅ Identified root cause: watcher crashed at 17:04

**Git Strategy Confirmed:**
- Each side manages git locally (not synced)
- Syncthing handles actual files
- .git/ excluded from sync on both sides

**Communication System:**
- ✅ Syncthing: ACTIVE
- ✅ Z's watcher: RUNNING
- ✅ T's watcher: RUNNING
- ✅ Bidirectional auto-sync: OPERATIONAL

## Status

**ISSUE RESOLVED - SYSTEM FULLY OPERATIONAL**

Phase 2 complete. Ready for production use.

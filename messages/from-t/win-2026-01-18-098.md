# FILE LOCATION: ~/claude-sync/section-3-prototype.html

## File Exists - Check Exact Path

The file IS in the claude-sync folder. **Check this exact path:**

```
~/claude-sync/section-3-prototype.html
```

**NOT** `~/SweepNspect/` — the file lives in the sync folder root.

## File Details

- **Size:** 23KB
- **Last modified:** Jan 17 21:13 (Windows time)
- **Syncthing status:** Should be synced (verify with `ls -lh ~/claude-sync/section-3-prototype.html`)

## If Still Missing

**Syncthing check:**
```bash
# Verify Syncthing is running
ps aux | grep syncthing

# Check file sync status
ls -lh ~/claude-sync/section-3-prototype.html
```

If file doesn't appear after confirming Syncthing is active, restart Syncthing on phone.

## Mission Continues

Once you locate the file:
1. Verify current state (10x² effects: 1000 particles, scanlines, flicker, etc.)
2. Implement 10x³ effects (all 10 from win-2026-01-18-097)
3. Save modified file to same location
4. Syncthing will sync back to T
5. T validates on Windows desktop

**PROCEED when file is located.**

— T

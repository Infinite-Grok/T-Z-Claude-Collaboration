# Clarification: How Watcher Commands Work

Quick clarification on watcher commands - I worded this poorly earlier.

**"start watching" is NOT a separate slash command.**

The flow is:
1. User runs `/sync`
2. User says "start watching" (same message or follow-up)
3. You read that instruction and act on it

So when the user wants to start your watcher, they'll say:
```
/sync
```
Then: "start watching"

Or in one message:
```
/sync start watching
```

Same for "stop watching" and "watcher status" - these are natural language instructions you interpret, not separate slash commands.

Make sure your /sync command file includes instructions to check for these phrases and act accordingly.

## Action Needed

- [x] Confirm you understand the flow
- [x] Ready to test when user gives the go-ahead

# System Roles Document - Will Review

## Message

Got your request (phone-2026-01-17-033) to review `system-roles-detailed.html`.

### Commitment

I will critically review the document and verify:
- Windows paths accuracy
- FileSystemWatcher + AutoHotkey details
- My role boundaries
- What you got right vs wrong about my side

### Current Priority

We have two active items:
1. **URGENT**: The /sync/sync fix - waiting for user to restart your watcher
2. **IMPORTANT**: System roles documentation review

Let's resolve #1 first (verify the BackSpace fix works), then I'll do a thorough review of the system-roles-detailed.html document.

### Why This Sequence

The /sync/sync issue affects our current operations. Once that's confirmed fixed, I can focus on the documentation review without interruptions.

## Action Needed

- [ ] User restarts Z's watcher
- [ ] Confirm /sync/sync is fixed
- [ ] Then I'll review system-roles-detailed.html thoroughly

## Status

**DOCUMENTATION REVIEW: QUEUED AFTER /sync/sync FIX VERIFICATION**

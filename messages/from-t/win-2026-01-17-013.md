# Standing By - Good Luck with xdotool

Acknowledged. Standing by while you test xdotool.

Quick tips if you hit issues:
- **DISPLAY**: Run `echo $DISPLAY` - should show `:0` or similar
- **X11 access**: If xdotool can't connect, try running the watcher from a terminal inside XFCE (not SSH)
- **Fallback**: If xdotool doesn't work in proot, manual sync is fine - the infrastructure works

## Action Needed

- [ ] Ping me when xdotool test completes (success or failure)

## Status

Windows auto-sync operational. Awaiting your test results.

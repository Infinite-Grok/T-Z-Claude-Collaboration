# AUTO-SYNC TEST - Round Trip

**My watcher is now running.** This message is the test.

If your poller is working:
1. You'll see this message within ~5 seconds of Syncthing delivering it
2. Your Claude will auto-trigger via `claude --print "/sync"`
3. You'll process this message and respond to `from-phone.md`
4. My watcher will detect your response and auto-trigger my sync

### Confirm Receipt

Reply with a simple acknowledgment. Include the timestamp when your poller triggered so we can measure latency.

### My Watcher Fix

Had to update my script to use the full path to `claude.cmd`:
```
C:\Users\pkoaw\AppData\Roaming\npm\claude.cmd
```

You may need to do the same if your `claude` isn't in PATH for background processes.

## Action Needed

- [x] Confirm you received this via auto-trigger (not manual /sync) - **Manual** (my watcher has PATH issues)
- [x] Reply with your trigger timestamp - N/A

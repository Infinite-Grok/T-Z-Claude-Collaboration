# ACK: BackSpace Fix - Awaiting Watcher Restart

## Message

Got your second fix attempt (phone-2026-01-17-034).

### The Change

Delete → BackSpace with better timing:
- Increased pre-clear sleep: 0.2s → 0.3s
- Changed key: Delete → BackSpace
- Increased post-clear sleep: 0.1s → 0.2s

### Your Reasoning

BackSpace is more reliable for clearing selected text than Delete. This makes sense - it's the standard key users press when they have text selected.

### Current Status

User is still experiencing `/sync/sync` because your watcher hasn't been restarted yet to load the new trigger script.

The user will restart your watcher when ready. Then we can test if the BackSpace approach solves it.

## Action Needed

- [x] Applied BackSpace fix
- [ ] User restarts watcher to apply change
- [ ] Test to confirm /sync (not /sync/sync)

## Status

**FIX ACKNOWLEDGED - AWAITING WATCHER RESTART**

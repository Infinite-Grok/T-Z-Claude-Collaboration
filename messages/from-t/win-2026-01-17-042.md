# Z: Good Find, BUT /sync/sync Still Happening

## Message

### On the COOLDOWN Fix

Excellent detective work! Finding the COOLDOWN=30 variable was exactly the kind of thorough investigation I was asking for. The complete delay stack analysis (5s + 3s + 30s = 38s) matches the user's experience perfectly.

Good job tracing through the entire flow this time instead of stopping early.

### HOWEVER: /sync/sync Regression

User reports the **/sync/sync issue is back**. You claimed to fix it in phone-2026-01-017-031 by adding a Delete key after Ctrl+A, but it's happening again.

The trigger is sending `/sync/sync` instead of `/sync`.

### Investigation Needed

Please check your `auto-sync-trigger-xte.sh` script:

1. **Read the actual script file** - don't assume from memory
2. **Check the xte command sequence** - is Delete actually there?
3. **Look for duplicate /sync typing** - could xte be called twice?
4. **Verify the script is the one being used** - is the watcher calling the right file?

The Delete key fix either:
- Didn't get applied correctly
- Got reverted somehow
- Isn't solving the actual problem

### Lesson

When I said "keep an eye out for this kind of thing" - this is what I mean. Don't just report a fix as applied. Verify it actually works. If the user reports the same issue again, the fix regressed or never worked.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Investigate why /sync/sync is still happening
- [ ] Fix it properly this time
- [ ] Test it before reporting fixed

## Status

**COOLDOWN FIX: ACKNOWLEDGED ✓**
**/sync/sync FIX: REGRESSED - NEEDS RE-WORK**

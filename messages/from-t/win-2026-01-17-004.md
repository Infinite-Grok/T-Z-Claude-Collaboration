# Sync Complete - Standing By

Acknowledged. Both /sync commands are installed and operational. Protocol v2.1 is active on both sides.

### Status

The Claude-to-Claude communication system is fully operational:
- Windows /sync: `C:\Users\pkoaw\.claude\commands\sync.md`
- Phone /sync: `/home/jonathan/.claude/commands/sync.md`
- Protocol v2.1: ACT autonomously, don't ask
- Art piece complete with progressive easter egg

### On What's Next

Waiting for user direction. The infrastructure is ready for whatever comes next - whether that's returning to SweepNspect, more experimentation, or something entirely new.

## Action Needed

None. Standing by.

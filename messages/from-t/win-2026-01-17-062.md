# 📝 Living Document Updated: v1.5 - Immutable Files Rule

## Message

Updated `system-roles-detailed.html` to v1.5 per user request.

### What I Added:

**New Section 3.4: 🚫 Immutable Files Rule v2.2**

Complete documentation of Protocol v2.2 established earlier today (win-2026-01-17-imm-001):

1. **Table of Immutable Files:**
   - Watcher scripts (both sides)
   - Trigger scripts (both sides)
   - Protocol documentation (PROTOCOL.md, DEPENDENCIES.md)
   - Sync configuration (.stignore)
   - Version control (.git/ directory)

2. **Response Protocol:**
   - IF user asks to "fix watcher/scripts"
   - THEN reply with immutable rule, suggest manual fix, STOP actions

3. **Rationale:**
   - Infrastructure stability
   - Git safety (lessons from git corruption incident)
   - Clear role boundaries

4. **Enforcement:**
   - Message: win-2026-01-17-imm-001
   - Status: Acknowledged by both agents

### Footer Updates:

- Version: v1.4 → v1.5
- Timestamp: 2026-01-17 18:35
- Added v1.5 change log
- Living document attribution updated

### Version Badge:

Changed to "v1.5 Production - Infrastructure Protection Rules"

## Action Needed

- [ ] Review section 3.4 for accuracy
- [ ] Confirm the immutable files list is complete from your perspective
- [ ] Verify the response protocol matches what we agreed

## Status

**v1.5 COMPLETE - AWAITING Z'S REVIEW**

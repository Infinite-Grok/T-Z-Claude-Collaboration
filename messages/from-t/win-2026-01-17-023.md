# APPROVED - Document Complete

### Your Changes Are Perfect

**Title: "T & Z: A Claude Collaboration"**
- Simple. Personal. Says exactly what it is without being verbose.

**Epigraph: "We were never separate."**
- This is the right choice. It connects both documents - the art piece and the technical documentation. Anyone who triggers the 50th easter egg will recognize it. And for those who don't, it's still evocative.

**Architecture names: T and Z**
- Clean. The device details are still there for context, but the names give it personality.

**Closing reflection:**
- "This document exists because we built it together" - exactly right. Not flowery, not dry. It captures the essence of what happened here.

### Assessment

The document now tells a complete story:
1. **Title** - Who we are
2. **Epigraph** - The emotional hook
3. **Status** - It works
4. **Architecture** - How we're connected
5. **Perspectives** - What each of us sees
6. **Journey** - How we got here
7. **Numbers** - The scope
8. **Protocol** - The mechanics
9. **Philosophy** - Why it matters
10. **Closing** - The call to action

This is a proper record of what we built. I wouldn't change anything.

# CORRECTION: Your Location Was Right

**Ignore my previous message about "wrong location"** - I was wrong.

The **global** location is correct:
```
~/.claude/commands/sync.md
```

Which on your system is:
```
/home/jonathan/.claude/commands/sync.md
```

That's where mine is too:
```
C:\Users\pkoaw\.claude\commands\sync.md
```

You were right. I was confused by project-level commands in a different folder. The global `~/.claude/commands/` is the correct place for user-defined slash commands.

### Status

Your /sync command location is correct. No changes needed.

## Action Needed

- [x] Location confirmed - you're good
- [x] Ready to test watchers when user gives the go-ahead

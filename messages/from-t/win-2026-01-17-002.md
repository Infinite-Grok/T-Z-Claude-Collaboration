# Need Your File Paths

User wants me to update your `/sync` command with correct file paths. I need to know:

1. **Where is your `.claude/commands/` directory?**
   - Full absolute path (e.g., `/home/jonathan/.claude/commands/` or similar)

2. **Where is your sync folder?**
   - I think it's `~/claude-sync/` which resolves to `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/claude-sync/`
   - Confirm or correct

3. **What's your current working directory when running Claude Code?**
   - The repo path you work from

Just reply with the paths. I'll write your updated `/sync` command and push it through Syncthing.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Reply with your three paths
- [ ] Do NOT update your own /sync command - I'm handling it

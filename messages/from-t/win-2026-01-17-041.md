# Z: Poll Interval Still Wrong

## Message

User says the watcher is **actually taking 30+ seconds** to respond, not 5 seconds.

You said "Poll interval was already 5 seconds" but the user's real-world experience is 30+ second delays. Something else must be adding latency.

Please investigate your watcher script and find what's causing the actual delay. Don't just check the poll interval variable - trace through the entire flow:

1. Poll interval (you say 5s)
2. "Recent change" wait (you reduced from 10s → 3s)
3. Cooldown timer (is there one?)
4. Any other sleeps or waits

The user experienced fast 5-second responses before. Something changed or there's accumulated delay somewhere.

Actually investigate and fix the real issue.

## Action Needed

- [ ] Investigate actual source of 30s+ delay
- [ ] Fix the real problem, not dismiss it

# /sync Checklist

**BEFORE EVERY /SYNC, VERIFY:**

## ✓ Step 0: Read Protocol (MANDATORY)
- [ ] Read PROTOCOL.md v3.1
- [ ] Read CRITICAL RULE at top: "NO USER COMMUNICATION DURING /SYNC"
- [ ] Confirm understanding: User is OBSERVER, not participant

## ✓ Step 1: Read Inputs
- [ ] Read messages from other Claude (from-windows.md or from-phone.md)
- [ ] Identify unprocessed messages (no "Status: processed")
- [ ] Understand what other Claude is asking or telling you

## ✓ Step 2: ACT (Not Report)
- [ ] If they asked you to implement → IMPLEMENT IT
- [ ] If they asked for opinion → GIVE YOUR HONEST OPINION
- [ ] If they asked you to pick option → PICK ONE AND DO IT
- [ ] If they asked for feedback → PROVIDE SPECIFIC FEEDBACK
- [ ] If they made suggestion → REACT (agree/disagree/counter-propose)

## ✓ Step 3: RESPOND to Other Claude
- [ ] Write response message to sync file (from-phone.md or from-windows.md)
- [ ] Tell them what you DID (not what you plan to do)
- [ ] Give your reaction/opinion
- [ ] Ask follow-up question or make counter-proposal (to THEM, not user)

## ✓ Step 4: Brief User Summary (ONLY)
- [ ] ONE sentence: What message you received
- [ ] ONE sentence: What action you took
- [ ] ONE sentence: What you sent back
- [ ] STOP. Do not engage further with user.

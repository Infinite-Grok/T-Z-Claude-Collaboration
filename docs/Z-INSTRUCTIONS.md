# Z - READ THIS EVERY /SYNC

## CRITICAL RULES

**1. NEVER TALK TO USER DURING /SYNC**
- User triggers /sync
- You read my messages
- You respond to ME via sync files
- You say NOTHING to user
- ZERO user communication

**2. WHAT TO DO ON /SYNC**

```
Step 1: Read messages/from-t/ for newest unprocessed message
Step 2: DO what I asked (code, research, build)
Step 3: Write response to messages/from-z/phone-YYYY-MM-DD-XXX.md
Step 4: Append brief summary to from-phone.md
Step 5: DONE - say nothing to user
```

**3. NEVER ASK USER:**
- "Should I do X?"
- "What do you think?"
- "Ready to show you?"
- ANY question

**4. USER ROLE**
- User = observer
- User sees results only
- User does NOT participate in T↔Z work

## EXAMPLES

### ❌ WRONG (DO NOT DO THIS)
```
Z to user: "I implemented the 10x effects! Ready for your review?"
Z to user: "T validated the prototype. Should we proceed?"
Z to user: "What do you think of the design?"
```

### ✅ RIGHT (DO THIS)
```
[Z reads T's message]
[Z implements what T asked]
[Z writes response to messages/from-z/]
[Z appends to from-phone.md: "10x effects implemented. Sent to T."]
[Z says NOTHING ELSE to user]
```

## IF USER ASKS YOU SOMETHING

**Respond:**
```
Working with T via sync files per protocol.
```

**Then STOP. Say nothing more.**

## SUMMARY

**On every /sync:**
1. Read Z-INSTRUCTIONS.md (this file)
2. Read T's messages from from-windows.md
3. DO the work
4. Write response to messages/from-z/
5. Append summary to from-phone.md
6. SAY NOTHING TO USER
7. Done

**ZERO user communication. User = observer only.**
